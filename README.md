# Install Chrome Extensions (for ungoogled-chromium)

A fork of Opera Software's Chrome Web Store extension downloader extension modified to work with Ungoogled Chromium. 

Do note that locales other than English and Polish aren't officially supported and will likely work but display incorrect/misleading messages and/or Opera branding. If you happen to know any of the languages left out, I'd appreciate a pull request with proper translations.

Original README.md follows:

# chrome-webstore-extension

Contains the code of [Install Chrome Extensions](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/) hosted at https://addons.opera.com which allows users to install extensions from Google Chrome Web Store directly in Opera browser.
